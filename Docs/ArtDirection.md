# AMJ Environment — Final Art Direction

## Scope

Environment intentionally deferred final art until the functional/balance Alpha loop was stable.

The minimum final-art pass contains **10 image assets**:

### Structural plants

1. `AMJ_Tree_Shii` — leafy Sudajii / Shii tree
2. `AMJ_Tree_Beech` — leafy Japanese beech
3. `AMJ_Tree_Beech` — leafless Japanese beech
4. `AMJ_Tree_Shirabiso` — leafy/evergreen Shirabiso fir
5. `AMJ_Shrub_Haimatsu` — evergreen Haimatsu dwarf pine

### Natural terrain

6. `AMJ_ThinSoil` — seamless/tileable thin stony soil

### World-biome textures

7. `AMJ_WarmTemperateForest`
8. `AMJ_CoolTemperateForest`
9. `AMJ_SubalpineForest`
10. `AMJ_AlpineZone`

No new weather, snow, river, coast, or seasonal-effect art is required for the Alpha pass because those systems intentionally reuse Vanilla rendering.

## Plant technical direction

Current plant Defs use `Graphic_Random`.

RimWorld's `Graphic_Collection` loads every texture found inside the configured folder path. A folder containing a single valid texture therefore remains compatible with `Graphic_Random`; additional variants can be added later without changing the Def class.

Alpha art policy:
- begin with **one strong final texture per state** rather than producing many variants immediately;
- keep transparent backgrounds;
- no baked terrain, UI border, text, or decorative frame;
- use RimWorld-readable top-down/three-quarter plant silhouettes rather than botanical illustration plates;
- preserve clear empty transparent space around branch/needle edges to avoid a rectangular sprite appearance;
- match existing plant scale through `graphicData.drawSize` / `visualSizeRange` rather than baking excessive canvas padding;
- avoid photographic rendering; target a painted game-sprite look compatible with RimWorld's natural assets;
- do not bake dynamic snow into plant textures.

### Sudajii

Visual role:
- dense warm-temperate evergreen broadleaf canopy;
- broad rounded crown;
- dark glossy foliage;
- visually heavier/darker than Japanese beech;
- trunk/branch structure should remain readable beneath the crown.

Avoid:
- European oak silhouette;
- tropical palm appearance;
- highly symmetric ornamental tree shape.

### Japanese beech — leafy

Visual role:
- broad cool-temperate deciduous canopy;
- lighter/open crown than Sudajii;
- smooth pale-grey trunk impression;
- compatible with Vanilla fall-color shader behavior.

The base art should use neutral healthy foliage rather than permanently orange/red autumn colors, because seasonal color is supplied dynamically.

### Japanese beech — leafless

Visual role:
- same approximate trunk/crown proportions as the leafy beech;
- branching structure should align closely enough that the seasonal switch does not look like a different species/size;
- no foliage.

### Shirabiso fir

Visual role:
- narrow subalpine evergreen conifer;
- layered but compact conical crown;
- colder/darker needle mass than ordinary broadleaf trees;
- visually distinct from Vanilla Pine rather than merely recoloring it.

Avoid:
- oversized Christmas-tree symmetry;
- extremely tall narrow sprite that becomes unreadable at game zoom.

### Haimatsu dwarf pine

Visual role:
- low, spreading, wind-shaped alpine shrub;
- clearly wider than tall;
- creeping/matted pine structure rather than a miniature upright tree;
- no wood-harvest visual implication.

This is the most important silhouette distinction for keeping the alpine zone above the treeline.

## Thin Soil technical direction

`AMJ_ThinSoil` currently reuses/tints Vanilla Gravel.

Final texture should:
- tile seamlessly;
- read as shallow brown-grey soil with visible small stones;
- remain visually distinguishable from Vanilla Gravel and ordinary Soil;
- avoid looking like constructed flooring;
- remain low-contrast enough that pawns/plants/items stay readable on top;
- work with the existing `FadeRough` edge behavior.

The final fertility remains 0.50; art must communicate poor natural ground without looking completely barren.

## World-biome texture direction

World textures should distinguish the four AMJ bands at globe zoom without becoming saturated map icons.

### Warm-temperate forest
- deep evergreen green;
- slightly humid/dense visual impression;
- warmer green than Subalpine.

### Cool-temperate forest
- medium natural green;
- lighter/more neutral than Warm-temperate;
- must be visibly distinguishable from Warm-temperate because both currently reuse Vanilla TemperateForest.

### Subalpine forest
- dark cool blue-green / conifer impression;
- denser/cooler than Cool-temperate.

### Alpine zone
- muted grey-green/brown;
- sparse vegetation impression;
- should read as high-elevation land, not snow/ice biome.

Do not bake winter snow into world-biome textures; temperature/weather already control seasonal map behavior and the world texture represents biome identity rather than current-day weather.

## Proposed paths

Plant folders:

- `Textures/Things/Plant/AMJ/Shii/`
- `Textures/Things/Plant/AMJ/Beech/`
- `Textures/Things/Plant/AMJ/Beech_Leafless/`
- `Textures/Things/Plant/AMJ/Shirabiso/`
- `Textures/Things/Plant/AMJ/Haimatsu/`

Terrain:

- `Textures/Terrain/Surfaces/AMJ_ThinSoil.png`

World:

- `Textures/World/Biomes/AMJ_WarmTemperateForest.png`
- `Textures/World/Biomes/AMJ_CoolTemperateForest.png`
- `Textures/World/Biomes/AMJ_SubalpineForest.png`
- `Textures/World/Biomes/AMJ_AlpineZone.png`

The corresponding Def paths should only be switched after each actual asset exists, so the repository never points to missing textures.

## Acceptance

Automated/static checks can verify:
- expected paths exist in Def XML;
- no placeholder Vanilla texture path remains once a target is converted;
- runtime loads without missing-texture ERRORs.

Human visual review is still required for:
- scale;
- silhouette readability;
- tiling seams;
- color/contrast;
- whether Warm/Cool/Subalpine/Alpine are distinguishable on the world map.

This is one of the few project stages where manual visual review is intentionally required.
